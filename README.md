Here you will see Evan's Apple CV MLE Case Study Code.

get_sizes.py is where I did my data analysis
crop_images.py is what I used to crop the images down to the desired size
cnn.py is where the model training and testing take place

You will need to input swap folders for the training and validation sets in both get_sizes and crop_images to get results for the desired folder.
